When i am not sleeping, i am AI dreaming :)

Exploring the frontier of AI tools, from conversational interfaces to agentic systems and MCP server adventures! ðŸ¤–âœ¨

I'm on a hands-on journey through the latest AI tools and technologies, figuring out what works, what doesn't, and how to actually use this stuff in real projects. This blog is my experimental playground where I document practical tutorials and discoveries.

Here you'll find:

- Conversational AI workflows and prompting experiments
- CLI AI tools and terminal integrations
- Agentic systems and autonomous AI workflows
- MCP server setups and custom integrations
- AI tool comparisons and practical guides
- Hands-on projects that combine multiple AI tools
- Core AI concepts explained simply (RAG, vector databases, embeddings, and more)

I write to make AI tools less intimidating and more useful â€” if you're looking to level up your AI tool game or collaborate on cool experiments, say hello via GitHub or email.

Stay curious â€” the AI tool explosion is just getting started, and I'm here to try everything so you don't have to! ðŸš€
